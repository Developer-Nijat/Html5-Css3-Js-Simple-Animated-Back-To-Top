SASS and CSS
We use SASS and Bourbon (http://bourbon.io/) for our resources. If you don't use SASS, just use the .css ﬁles that you ﬁnd in the css folder. You can delete both sass and partials folders.We have integrated Meyerweb CSS reset rules (http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) and Modernizr (http://modernizr.com/).
